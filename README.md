### Wazobia Frontend Engineer Assessment

---

Hello ðŸ‘‹. If you are seeing this, that means you are about to take the Frontend Engineer Assessment.

Basically, you will be building an extremely simple application in which users can signup,login, verify their accounts and implement CRUD operations on Item resources.

To build this application, you will be connecting to the API deployed at [test-api.sytbuilder.com](https://test-api.sytbuilder.com "test-api.sytbuilder.com"). This API is implemented in both GraphQL and REST.
